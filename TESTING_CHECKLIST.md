## üß™ Azure Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Health Check
```bash
curl https://pixcrawler-test-YOUR-ID.azurewebsites.net/health
```
- [ ] Returns `{"status": "healthy"}`
- [ ] HTTP 200 status code

### Test 2: API Documentation
Visit: `https://pixcrawler-test-YOUR-ID.azurewebsites.net/docs`
- [ ] Swagger UI loads
- [ ] All endpoints visible
- [ ] Can interact with API

### Test 3: Start Generation Job
```bash
curl -X POST "https://pixcrawler-test-YOUR-ID.azurewebsites.net/api/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "dataset_name": "azure_test",
    "categories": {"animals": ["cat"], "vehicles": ["car"]},
    "max_images": 5,
    "keyword_generation": "disabled"
  }'
```
- [ ] Returns job_id
- [ ] Status is "pending"
- [ ] Created timestamp present

### Test 4: Check Job Status
```bash
curl "https://pixcrawler-test-YOUR-ID.azurewebsites.net/api/status/JOB-ID"
```
- [ ] Status changes from "pending" to "running"
- [ ] Eventually becomes "completed"
- [ ] No errors reported
- [ ] Total images count present

### Test 5: List Generated Images
```bash
curl "https://pixcrawler-test-YOUR-ID.azurewebsites.net/api/images/JOB-ID"
```
- [ ] Returns list of images
- [ ] Each image has URL
- [ ] Each image has category
- [ ] Total count matches expectation

### Test 6: Access Individual Image
Visit: `https://pixcrawler-test-YOUR-ID.azurewebsites.net/images/JOB-ID/animals/000001.jpg`
- [ ] Image displays in browser
- [ ] Image downloads successfully
- [ ] Correct content-type header
- [ ] File size reasonable

## üéØ Goal Verification

### ‚úÖ Goal 1: Can Azure generate images locally on cloud?
- [ ] Images downloaded from search engines
- [ ] Images stored in datasets/ directory
- [ ] Integrity checks performed
- [ ] No Azure policy blocks

**Evidence:**
- Job status shows "completed"
- Total images count > 0
- No permission errors in logs

### ‚úÖ Goal 2: Can you get URLs for each image?
- [ ] `/api/images/{job_id}` returns URLs
- [ ] URLs are accessible
- [ ] Images viewable in browser
- [ ] URLs follow pattern: `/images/{job_id}/{category}/{filename}`

**Evidence:**
- Image list endpoint works
- Individual image URLs work
- Can download images via URLs

## üìä Performance Metrics

Record these for reference:

| Metric             | Value         |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Images requested   | _____         |
| Images downloaded  | _____         |
| Time to complete   | _____ seconds |
| Total dataset size | _____ MB      |
| Disk space used    | _____ MB      |
| Memory usage peak  | _____ MB      |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

If tests fail, check:

### Application Won't Start
- [ ] Check logs: `az webapp log tail`
- [ ] Verify startup.sh is configured
- [ ] Check Python version in runtime.txt
- [ ] Verify all dependencies in requirements-azure.txt

### Job Stays Pending
- [ ] Check background task started
- [ ] Review application logs
- [ ] Verify PixCrawler dependencies installed
- [ ] Check for import errors

### Images Not Accessible
- [ ] Verify job status is "completed"
- [ ] Check datasets/ directory exists
- [ ] Verify file permissions
- [ ] Check path security validation

### Out of Disk Space
- [ ] Check disk usage in SSH session
- [ ] Reduce max_images parameter
- [ ] Clear old datasets
- [ ] Consider upgrading tier

## üßπ Cleanup Checklist

After testing is complete:

### Option 1: Stop (Keep for Later)
```bash
az webapp stop \
  --resource-group pixcrawler-rg \
  --name pixcrawler-test-YOUR-ID
```
- [ ] App stopped (no charges while stopped)
- [ ] Can restart later

### Option 2: Delete Everything
```bash
az group delete --name pixcrawler-rg --yes
```
- [ ] Resource group deleted
- [ ] All resources removed
- [ ] No ongoing charges
