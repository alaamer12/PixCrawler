# Component Interaction

## Executive Summary

The PixCrawler system employs a sophisticated multi-layered architecture designed to handle large-scale image dataset creation with high reliability, performance, and maintainability. This document provides a comprehensive analysis of component interactions, data flows, and architectural decisions that enable the platform to process thousands of images efficiently while maintaining data quality and system stability.

## System Architecture Philosophy

PixCrawler follows a **microservices-oriented architecture** with clear separation of concerns across multiple layers. This design philosophy ensures:

- **Scalability**: Individual components can scale independently based on demand
- **Maintainability**: Isolated services reduce complexity and enable focused development
- **Resilience**: Failure in one component doesn't cascade to the entire system
- **Extensibility**: New features and integrations can be added with minimal impact

## Component Interaction Overview

The PixCrawler ecosystem consists of five primary architectural layers, each serving distinct functional responsibilities while maintaining loose coupling through well-defined interfaces.

### Layer-by-Layer Analysis

### 1. Frontend Layer

The **Frontend Layer** provides the user interface and client-side logic, built on modern web technologies:

- **Dashboard UI (Next.js)**: Serves as the primary user interface, offering intuitive dataset configuration, job monitoring, and result visualization. The Next.js framework provides server-side rendering capabilities for improved performance and SEO.
- **Auth Components (Supabase Auth)**: Handles user authentication, session management, and authorization flows. Integration with Supabase provides enterprise-grade security with minimal overhead.
- **State Management (Zustand/Redux)**: Manages client-side application state, ensuring consistent data flow and reactive UI updates across components.

### 2. API Gateway Layer

The **API Gateway Layer** acts as the single entry point for all client requests, providing essential cross-cutting concerns:

- **API Gateway**: Implements rate limiting, request routing, and load balancing to protect backend services from overload and ensure fair resource allocation.
- **Middleware Stack**: Provides authentication verification, CORS policy enforcement, request logging, and error handling in a composable pipeline architecture.
- **Route Handler (FastAPI Router)**: Processes incoming requests and routes them to appropriate backend services based on endpoint configuration and business logic.

### 3. Backend Services Layer

The **Backend Services Layer** contains the core business logic organized into focused, domain-specific services:

- **User Service**: Manages user profiles, preferences, and account-related operations with comprehensive data validation and security measures.
- **Dataset Service**: Handles dataset metadata management, configuration validation, and CRUD operations with strong consistency guarantees.
- **Job Service**: Orchestrates dataset creation jobs, managing lifecycle states, progress tracking, and result coordination.
- **Storage Service**: Abstracts file system operations, providing unified access to both hot and warm storage tiers with automatic optimization.
- **Validation Service**: Implements quality control mechanisms for images and datasets, ensuring data integrity and compliance with user requirements.

### 4. Processing Layer

The **Processing Layer** contains the core image processing and dataset generation logic:

- **Job Orchestrator**: Manages complex multi-step workflows, handling dependency resolution, error recovery, and resource allocation across distributed workers.
- **Builder Core**: Coordinates the main dataset building process, integrating multiple specialized components to execute the complete processing pipeline.
- **Image Downloader**: Implements high-performance, fault-tolerant downloading from multiple search engines with intelligent retry mechanisms and rate limiting.
- **Image Validator**: Performs comprehensive image quality assessment using multiple validation strategies (fast, medium, slow) based on processing requirements.
- **Dataset Generator**: Organizes processed images into structured datasets with proper labeling, metadata generation, and format optimization.

### 5. Infrastructure Layer

The **Infrastructure Layer** provides foundational services and data persistence:

- **Task Queue (Celery/Redis)**: Enables asynchronous task processing with reliable job distribution, retry mechanisms, and monitoring capabilities.
- **Cache Layer (Redis)**: Provides high-performance caching for frequently accessed data, session storage, and temporary processing artifacts.
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Ensures ACID-compliant data persistence with advanced features like JSON support, full-text search, and replication.
- **Cloud Storage**: Offers scalable object storage with multiple access tiers, enabling cost-effective data management across different usage patterns.
- **Logging System**: Implements centralized, structured logging with search capabilities, enabling comprehensive system monitoring and debugging.

## Detailed Component Interactions

### Frontend Component Communication Flow

The frontend follows a unidirectional data flow pattern that ensures predictable state management and optimal user experience.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant D as Dashboard
    participant S as State Manager
    participant A as Auth Component
    participant API as API Client

    U->>D: Interact with UI
    D->>A: Check Auth Status
    A-->>D: Auth State
    D->>S: Update Local State
    S->>API: Make API Call
    API-->>S: Response Data
    S->>D: Update UI State
    D-->>U: Render Updated UI

```

**Interaction Analysis:**

1. **User Interaction**: All user interactions are captured by the Dashboard UI, which acts as the primary interface controller.
2. **Authentication Check**: Before processing any action, the system verifies user authentication status to ensure secure access.
3. **State Synchronization**: Local state updates are managed centrally, ensuring consistent application state across all components.
4. **API Communication**: The API client handles all server communication with proper error handling and retry logic.
5. **UI Updates**: Reactive state management triggers automatic UI updates, providing immediate feedback to users.

### Backend Service Orchestration Pattern

Backend services implement a choreographed service interaction pattern that promotes loose coupling while ensuring reliable data consistency.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant API as API Router
    participant DS as Dataset Service
    participant JS as Job Service
    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant Q as Queue
    participant W as Worker
    participant B as Builder

    API->>DS: Create Dataset
    DS->>JS: Create Job
    JS->>O: Schedule Processing
    O->>Q: Queue Task
    Q->>W: Assign Worker
    W->>B: Execute Builder
    B-->>W: Processing Results
    W->>JS: Update Job Status
    JS-->>API: Status Response

```

**Service Interaction Principles:**

1. **Request Validation**: The API router validates all incoming requests before forwarding to appropriate services.
2. **Service Coordination**: Each service maintains its own data consistency while coordinating with related services through well-defined contracts.
3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Long-running tasks are offloaded to the queue system, allowing the API to respond immediately with job tracking information.
4. **Progress Tracking**: Job status updates flow back through the service chain, enabling real-time progress monitoring.
5. **Error Propagation**: Failures are captured and propagated back through the service chain with appropriate error context.

## Communication Patterns and Protocols

### Asynchronous Processing Pattern

The system implements sophisticated asynchronous processing to handle long-running tasks while maintaining responsive user interfaces.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

    participant N as Notification

    A->>Q: Queue Task
    A-->>A: Return Job ID
    Q->>W: Assign Task
    W->>W: Process Images
    W->>S: Store Results
    W->>N: Send Progress Update
    N-->>A: WebSocket Event

    Note over A,N: Asynchronous flow for long-running tasks

```

### Communication Protocol Details

**HTTP/REST API**

- **Synchronous Operations**: User management, configuration, short queries
